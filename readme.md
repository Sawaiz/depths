# Depths
In a weekly episode over four months, ten seekers will recommend unappreciated songs given a theme. A master playlist for each week will be created highlighting those pieces.

## Guidelines
- The Voyage lasts four months, and the ten seekers will participate for sixteen weeks.
- The songs must be less than 12m long, pieces under 6 minutes are preferred to keep the playlist around an hour.
- Seekers will be contacted each week through email with the theme, and will have six days to submit.
- The list of previous episodes is provided, please don't submit duplicates.
- Album versions are preferred, but if no good version is available, a live recording will be accepted.
- The “theme” is open to interpretation, it's there to reduce overchoice, make your choices your own, it yields more diverse pieces. There are no boundaries in language, genre, or content.
- The playlist will be voted on and then the order will be curated to provide the best listening experience.
