        In a weekly episode over four months, ten seekers will recommend unappreciated songs given a theme. A master playlist for each week will be created highlighting those pieces.
    </p>

    <p>
        New depths of sound demand to be discovered, with the seekers being selected from diverse backgrounds and musical tastes. Music can be private; it's easy to share yet rarely is. The seekers are veiled, the listeners learn about them only through their selections.
    </p>
